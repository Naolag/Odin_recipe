    <p>So what are we grilling now that we've dusted off the old grates? Other than the usual fare, we personally can't wait to prep some pies.</p>
    <p> The recipe page makes it easy, too: "Pizza on the grill is a fantastic way to make [it] at home. The heat of a hot grill is a perfect match for a professional pizza oven. 
        Learn the tricks for making and grilling pizza from scratch with this recipe. Feel free to use your favorite toppings, but keep in mind not to overload the pizza." </p>

    <h1>Directions </h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Sprinkle salt onto a plate. Moisten the rim of a glass with lime wedge. Press the moistened rim into the salt. Fill the glass with ice. </li>
        <li>Fill a cocktail shaker with jalapeno slices and strawberries, reserving 1 slice of strawberry for garnish. Use a muddler to crush the jalapeno and strawberries to release their juices. Add tequila, triple sec, 
            lime juice and simple syrup to the shaker and add 1 cup of ice. Seal and shake vigorously until outside is frosted, 10 to 15 seconds. </li>
